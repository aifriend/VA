USER CASE

FORMULACION
If a NLU prediction has a low confidence score, the user is asked to affirm the classification of the intent.
If they affirm, the story continues as if the intent was classified with high confidence from the beginning.
If they deny, the user is asked to rephrase their message.

REFORMULACION
If the classification of the rephrased intent was confident, the story continues as if the user had this intent from the beginning.
If the rephrased intent was not classified with high confidence, the user is asked to affirm the classified intent.
If the user affirms the intent, the story continues as if the user had this intent from the beginning.
If the user denies, an ultimate fallback action is triggered (e.g. a handoff to a human).
